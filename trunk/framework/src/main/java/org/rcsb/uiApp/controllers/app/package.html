<p>
The App is the initiating and contact point for the application.  It contains
an accessor to a static singleton instance of the app.
</p>
The application main() entry point should be implemented in the application-derived
AppBase class.</p>
<p>
The app instance is retrieved via a static accessor:</p>
<code>
  AppBase app = AppBase.getApp();
</code>
<p>
The app instance has a number of accessors to retrieve the active document
frame, which in turn has a number of accessors to retrieve doc-centric controllers,
(doc controller, scene controller, update controller, etc.</p>
<p>
In addition, the app class provides a number of static <em>folded</em> accessors
that collapse the accessor chain to a single call from the AppBase class.</p>
<p>
For instance, instead of calling:
<code>
Model model = AppBase.getApp().getActiveFrame().getModel();
</code>
<p>
You can simply call:
</p>
<code>
Model model = AppBase.sGetModel();
</code>
<p>
The call is defined to go through the active frame, internally.
</p>
<h2>Module/Component Construction</h2>
<p>
The framework controls when certain modules/components are created, thus a deriving
application can't just create these up front and pass derived versions into the
framework.</p>
<p>
Instead, a factory class is embedded into the AppBase class, called <em>AppModuleFactory</em>.
Static creator functions (named create&gt;xxx&lt;) are called on to instantiate major modules
required by the framework.  Example modules are:</p>
<code>
<ul>
<li>createDocController();</li>
<li>createDocFrame();<sup>*</sup></li>
<li>createGlGeometryViewer();</li>
<li>createModel();</li>
<li>createSceneController();</li>
</ul>
</code>
<h2>Deriving Components</h2>
<p>
To provide derived components to the framework, you need to derive the internal
<em>AppModuleFactory</em> from within your AppBase-derived class.  Derive the
necessary components, and then override the appropriate create&lt;xxx&gt;() function
for that module.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><em>createDocFrame()</em> is required - if you derive the AppModuleFactory in your
      application, you must derive <em>createDocFrame()</em> and add a creator.</li>
  </ul>
