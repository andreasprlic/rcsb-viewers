<title>RCSB Viewer Framework - Doc Controllers</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
This package consists of extensions to the {@linkplain org.rcsb.uiApp.controllers.doc} package, to provide
3d application viewer functionality.</p>
<p>
See that package for underlying implementation details and theory.</p>
<p>
Note: Viewers that derive Doc Controller classes, should check and insure they are derived from
the VF versions (if present), rather than the UIApp versions.</p>
