File loaders are contained in this package.  Currently, only two filetypes are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>.pdb ({@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.structLoader.PDBStructureLoader}) - the original 80 character punchcard image format.</li>
<li>.xml ({@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.structLoader.XMLStructureLoader}) - an xml representation of .cif data.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note the {@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.structLoader.IStructureLoader} interface.  This primarily defines
common accessors to resultant information from the loading operation.</p>
<p>
Both the {@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.structLoader.PdbStructureLoader} and the
{@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.structLoader.StructureXMLHandler} are capable of loading
gzip'ed files.</p>
<h3>Non-protein Chain Identification and Breakout</h3>
<p>
There was a significant difference in the way these loaded the structure - a problem for
further viewing and analysis.  The XMLStructureLoader has far more data to work with and
can break out non-protein information more completely.  The PDBStructureLoader has far less
information to work with, however it can approximate the XMLStructureLoader behavior.</p>
<p>
Read the documentation at the head of each of these for further information.</p>
<p style="color:red">
Note: The structure loaders were originally served up by a factory class that instantiated
and provided loaders by type requested.  That mechanism has been completely bypassed, so
I've lifted it out and put it in in the 'RCSB Excluded' project.</p>
<p>
A shame, really - I thought it was a good idea.</p>
