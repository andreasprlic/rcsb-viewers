<h3>Iterim Conformation Classes</h3>
<p>
These classes are interim, in the sense that they are collected and created on parsing the file.
Lists of these are kept in the Structure, where they are analyzed and then turned into the actual
constructs used in the StructureMap.</p>
<p>
Don't expect to see these in the StructureMap - they are all turned into
@{linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.model.Fragment} classes, with conformation code identifying
the type of second order structure.</p>
