<BODY>
This package provides classes which implement extra functionality on top
of the core MBT classes (that is, capabilities that are not absolutely
required by, or would otherwise overcomplicate, the core classes).
<p>
Classes here are used to determine bond types, contain dictionaries,
calculate statistics, etc.</p>
