This package contains transform utilities used to create various transformations, including symmetry operations.
<p>
It is distinct from similar operations in the graphics libraries, in that it doesn't require OpenGL or any other
graphics library support.</p>

It could be (and would be a good idea) to re-base this on the vecmath classes found in the 3rd Party libs, since
much of what this does is duplicated there.  Doing so would eliminate redundant functionality, and would provide
a natural out for expansion.</p>
