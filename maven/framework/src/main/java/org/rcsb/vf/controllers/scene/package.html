The scene is the graphics representation of the model.
This controls aspects of the scene (not to be confused with the actual rendering of the
scene.)  It references and manages view attributes, such as selection enabling,
asymmetric viewing, global transform enabling/disabling, etc.
<p>
In addition it is the focal point for geometry bounds determination.</p>
