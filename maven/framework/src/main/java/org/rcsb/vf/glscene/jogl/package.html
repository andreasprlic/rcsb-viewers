<title>RCSB Viewer Framework - GLScene</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
This package is where most of the graphics geometry and the GL-specific implementation resides.</p>
<p>
It could likely be split into non-GL-specific geometry, and GL-specific geometry packages.</p>
<p>
Some important classes are highlighted below:</p>

<h3>&ltcomponent-type&gtGeometry Classes</h3>
<p>
These correspond to the renderable model component-type classes - Atom, Bonds and Chain in particular.
Actual rendering is performed in these classes.  Note that on first pass, the geometry is defined and
compiled into a display list.  On subsequent passes, only the display list is invoked, if it exists.</p>
<h3>@{linkplain GlGeometryViewer}</h3>
<p>
Intercepts redraw requests and performs rendering - either for visualization or picking.</p>
<p>
<h3>{@linkplain JoglSceneNode}</h3>
<p>
Really should be renamed 'Scene' - contains the definition of the scene, and is carried directly in the
{@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.model.StructureMap} class.
