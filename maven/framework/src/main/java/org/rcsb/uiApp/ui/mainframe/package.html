Contains the base class for the main or 'document frame', and components common to it.
<p>
This class is in a somewhat volatile state - it's primary reason for existence is to allow
the kiosk viewer (or kiosk-like viewers) to bypass the ViewerFramework (which builds things like
menus and control side panels.)</p>
<p>
There's some question as to whether this really belongs here, or should be kicked up and
melded in with the RCSB Viewer Framework project.</p>
