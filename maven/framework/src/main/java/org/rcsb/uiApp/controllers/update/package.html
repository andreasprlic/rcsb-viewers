<p>
When the model or other aspects of the scene or viewer changes, update notifications need to be
forwarded to the concerned parties.  The implementation is an 'observer' pattern, where interested
parties register with the update controller, and are notified by it when necessary.</p>
<p>
The primary class is {@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.controllers.update.UpdateController}.
In addition there are two support classes:</p>
<dl>
<dt>{@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.controllers.update.UpdateEvent}</dt>
<dd>
An update event contains information for the update.  It is created by the update controller
and then forwarded to the registered recipients.</dd>
<dt>{@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.controllers.update.IUpdateListener}</dt>
<dd>
Registrants must implement this interface to receive updates.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Update Flow</h2>
</p>
The ideal sequence of update flow can be visualized in the following diagram:</p>

<p>
In this conception, changes are never reflected by the UI, directly, but are updated by the
model.</p>
<p>
Not all updates in the MBT occur this way, at present, however further changes and refactoring
are continuing in that direction.</p>
