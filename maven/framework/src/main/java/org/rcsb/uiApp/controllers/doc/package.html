This package consists fundamentally of the {@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.controllers.doc.DocController}
class.  It's primary function is to honor and fulfill structure file loading requests.
<p>
This class returns a Structure class {@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.model.Structure},
full of structure components ({@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.model.StructureComponent}).
It is up to the application to then determine what to do with the structure - in most
cases (viewers), the app will go on to create and add a Structure Map
{@linkplain org.rcsb.model.StructureMap}.
