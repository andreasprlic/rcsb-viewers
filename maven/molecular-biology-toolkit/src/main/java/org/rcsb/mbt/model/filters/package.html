This package provides classes which enable filtering or subsetting
of a structure's constituent components. For example, an instance of the
{@link org.rcsb.mbt.model.filters.CAlphaAtomFilter} class could be passed to the
"createStructureComponentIterator" method of the
{@link org.rcsb.mbt.model.Structure} class in order to create a
{@link org.rcsb.mbt.model.StructureComponentIterator}. Subsequent calls to this
iterator's "next" method would enable an application to step through only
C-Alpha atoms within the sturcture.
