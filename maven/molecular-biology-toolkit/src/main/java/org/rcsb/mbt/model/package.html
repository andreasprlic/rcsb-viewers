This is the model description package.  Salient classes here are:
<ol>
<dl>
<dt>{@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.model.StructureComponent}</dt>
<dd>
Base class for all of the structure components that make up a structure &mdash; atoms, bonds,
helices, coils, etc.</dd>
<dd>
There is a class derived from StructureComponent for each of the structure component types.</dd>
<dt>{@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.model.StructureComponentRegistry}</dt>
<dd>
Contains enumerations for each of the structure component types.
<blockquote style="color:red">
Note: These are currently strings per a JDK 1.0 implementation - expect them to change to enums, in the future.
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>{@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.model.Structure}</dt>
<dd>
<img src="doc-files/Structure.jpg" /><br/>
Class that serves as a container for all of the components.  This is pretty much
a dumb container - it doesn't know about relations of the things it contains.  That's reserved
for the 'StructureMap' class (see next.)</dd>
<dt>{@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.model.StructureMap}</dt>
<dd>
<img src="doc-files/StructureMap.jpg" /><br/>
This is a partner class contained by the 'Structure' class that describes all
of the relationships of the contained components.  This also contains the sub-scene information
for viewers.</dd>
<dt>{@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.model.StructureModel}</dt>
<dd>Consists fundamentally of a list of structures.  It also has mechanisms to trigger notifications
when a structure changes.</dd>
