Demos here are intended to exercise just the MBT.</p>
<p>
Some notes on the enclosed demos:</p>
<dl>
<dt>SimpleReadStructureDemo.java</dt>
<dd>
This simply reads a structure and then dumps it in reports.  Two salient issues, here:
<ul>
This should <em>only</em> require the {@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.model} and the {@linkplain org.rcsb.mbt.structLoader}
packages.  You should be able to run this against the corresponding output jars and get <em>no unresolveds.</em>
(To do this, you need to copy out the jars and copy out the source into its own directory, compile and run.)
If you <em>do</em> get unresolveds, it means some dependency has incurred itself into the model that shouldn't be there.</ul>
</dd>
<dt>DumpPeriodicTable</dt>
<dd>
The MBT carries an internal representation of the periodic table.  This dumps it.  Note the color
and radius are default and VDW, respectively.  They may be changed by a mutator to reflect some
other information for actual rendering.<br>
{@see org.rcsb.mbt.model.attributes} package for further information.
